# Code example usage for "Symbolic Audio Classification via Modal Decision Tree Learning", ITADATA2024.

This repo contains a [Jupyter Notebook](ItaData2024_code.ipynb) showcasing the proposed workflow for obtaining symbolic rules for symbolic audio classification.
 
The code is based on [*Sole.jl*](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl), an open-source framework for *symbolic machine learning*, originally designed for machine learning based on modal logics.

The package is mantained by the [ACLAI Lab](https://aclai.unife.it/en/) @ University of Ferrara.
